❖ What you are required to do:
  You will be given a prolog source file containing the level data (like the file 
attached with this document) and you are required to make a prolog 
program that produces a list of moves for each possible safe path from the 
start to the finish square and states the number of stars that can be collected 
in each path. Your prolog source file should only contain the predicates and 
rules needed by the solver; however, it shouldn’t define any facts about the 
level configuration.

❖ A sample test case:
  This test case shows the sample input that should be entered and what the 
output should look like. Notice that this output is the output produced when 
we run the solver on the level shown in the first figure.
